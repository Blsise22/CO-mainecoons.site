          Adopter agrees to inform us upon any change in contact information, within 90 days, so we can maintain compliance with record keeping.

Adopter agrees to quarantine their new Maine Coon from other household pets for the 48-hour health guarantee period. Kitten/Cat should be quarantined until examined by the Adopter‚Äôs licensed veterinarian (within the 48-hour period).<br> It is the Adopter‚Äôs responsibility to have the Kitten/Cat examined by a licensed veterinarian within 48 hours of receipt of Kitten/Cat for guarantee to be valid.<br> Failure to have Kitten/Cat checked by a licensed veterinarian within 48 hours will void the health guarantee. During this exam Adopter agrees to combo test their new Maine Coon kitten for FIV/Leukemia and keep their negative results for their own record keeping. All Maine Coon kittens are guaranteed to be negative for FIV/Leukemia. After the 48-hour health guarantee period, the we(Breeders) cannot be held accountable for future diagnosis of FeL/FIV or any other bacterial, viral, infectious diseases, or parasites due to the fact that these can be contracted anywhere in the environment after leaving the cattery and are not a result of genetics or breeding. Adopter accepts all responsibility for protection of Kitten/Cat from said diseases, illnesses, parasites, and fungi. This guarantee becomes void if Kitten/Cat comes into contact with another feline before being checked by a licensed veterinarian and tested first. If upon examination the Kitten/Cat is diagnosed with a life-threatening illness it is required that the we (Breeders) are notified immediately by Adoptee via both Whatsapp and email along with a written letter and phone consult from the diagnosing veterinarian.

          Adopter agrees to provide their Maine Coon with an annual echocardiogram (ultrasound) of the heart with a Board Certified Cardiologist beginning at 2 years of age to monitor any changes in their cat's heart. Adopter understands that HCM is a concern in the Maine Coon breed and agrees to share copies of the Maine Coon‚Äôs future annual HCM scans with Co-MaineCoon Kittens to assist in the prevention of life-threatening congenital heart defects in our breeding program.

Adopter understands the importance of preventative HCM screenings and agrees to be proactive in their cat's future health. Examining our cats on a regular basis is advantageous because it may allow for the identification of the disease (which often shows no outward symptoms) and thereby may allow early treatment which potentially could save and/or significantly prolong your cat's life. Adopter understands if they neglect to scan their Maine Coon for HCM, they do so understanding the potential risk.
